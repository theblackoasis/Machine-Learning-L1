Global factors such as geo-political tensions, the US dollar strengthening and the second straight month of selling from the FPI/FII segment played their role,"" Kunj Bansal - Executive Director & CIO – Equity, Centrum Wealth Management said.The fall was largely because of worries of likely increase in fiscal deficit, especially after expectations of fiscal stimulus.Media reports indicated that the government could announce a stimulus package worth more than USD 7 billion, which may widen the fiscal deficit for the financial year ending March 2018 to 3.7 percent of GDP from a budgeted target of 3.2 percent.“Stimulus can potentially increase the central government’s fiscal deficit to 3.5-3.7 percent of GDP in FY18, from the budgeted 3.2 percent target (3.5 percent of GDP achieved in FY17), depending on the size of the stimulus (0.3-0.5 percent of GDP),” Deutsche Bank said in a report.Today's fall wiped out investors’ wealth by about Rs 1.4 lakh crore, on top of Rs 2.68 lakh crore erosion in previous session.The BSE Midcap index lost 1 percent and Smallcap shed 2 percent.The gap between advances and declines also narrowed in the last hour of trade.

Oberoi Realty gained nearly 4 percent on residential project deal with Glaxo Pharma.Coffee Day Enterprises plunged 8 percent as a media report indicated that Income Tax Department has detected undisclosed income worth over Rs 650 crore linked to the group after raids."

""Therefore, staff strength at Sebi needs to be increased to strengthen its monitoring and enforcement functions,"" the panel headed by eminent banker Uday Kotak recommended. It suggested SebiIt suggested SEBI to outsource certain functions with relevant safeguards. According to the panel, successful enforcement actions by SEBI can have the twin effect of penalising the guilty, on the one hand, and creating a significant deterrent effect on the other hand.                                                                                                                                                                  However, for such deterrent effects to be felt in India, SEBI must equip itself so that it can adroitly gather evidence with the objective of ""investigate to litigate"".It suggested SEBI to develop teams comprising data scientists, accountants, lawyers specialised in corporate law, software engineers and academicians. The members need to have depth of knowledge within their respective areas as also possess broad expertise across functional areas.In addition, SEBI should build its market intelligence through regular review of market research and reports of proxy advisors.""SEBI, therefore needs to follow regulators across the world in utilising specialist hires. It may even consider creating a revolving door policy between employees at Sebi and in the private sector, allowing Sebi to hire laterals,"" the panel suggested."

# Machine-Learning-L1
Mentorship Repository for Machine Learning Type = Level 1
> [www.twoleaps.com](www.twoleaps.com)

## Repository Navigation Guide
* Mentee needs to fork this repository.
* Mentor needs to join as a contributor.

This template is designed to assist Twoleaps mentorship program. The template consists of two 
major sections: Goals and Progress tracker. Mentors and mentee should add goals prior to start of 
mentorship. Goals should be such that both party agree on. Progress tracker is to be updated on week
by week basis with new tasks to complete the defined goals. For each week, a folder in the repository
has to be maintained which captures the work done. It can be a small essay of things learned or written
code etc.

## Providing Feedback

Regular feedback is highly encouraged. Feedbacks should inspire improvement. Mentors should summarize week by week progress in form of feedback whenever possible and add it to the weekly work folder in form of *week1/feedback.md*

## Timeline

<Add mentorship timeline here in weeks. Example: 8 weeks starting 10th August>


## Goals
The objectives of the mentorship should be listed down here. They can be customized over time by the mentor
or the mentee's preferences.

## Micro project
> Implementing Penalized Linear Models to Predict Wine Cost

**Problem statement:** Mr Dough is the owner of a wine shop and wants to smartly manage his inventory by allocating the right amount of funds.  To do so he needs to know prices of wines in future. As Mr Dough doesn't know how to solve this problem, instead he hires you, a tech-savvy person. Your task is to build a ML model based on properties of wine to predict their cost in future.
